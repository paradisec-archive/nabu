    %h4 What system runs this site?

    %p.indent
      %b Nabu
      is a media management system that provides a catalog of items, metadata for these items, and information about the workflow status of the items. It also provides access, where possible, to those items.

    %p.indent
      'Nabu' is a word in the South Efate language for 'road', as a connector of various locations.

    %p.indent

    %h4 What material does this collection contain?

    %p.indent
      %b PARADISEC
      (Pacific And Regional Archive for DIgital Sources in Endangered Cultures) curates digital material about small or endangered languages.

    %p.indent
      The catalog entry for an item is usually written by the depositor, and some are more detailed than others. In the case of collections that we have digitised from deceased researchers, we do the best we can to describe the records, but often there is little information available. By placing these items in the collection we hope that other researchers will enrich the descriptions as they use the material. PARADISEC has a commitment to freedom of expression and universal access to information. PARADISEC recognises that there may be occasions when online material contains information that is culturally sensitive, or breaches copyright or other relevant law, and enforces access restrictions whenever we are made aware of such issues. If you find material in PARADISECâ€™s online collections that you believe infringes your rights, or, for example, contravenes privacy law, is defamatory, or is in breach of copyright, you may submit a takedown request by sending an email to <a href="mailto:admin@paradisec.org.au">admin@paradisec.org.au</a>.
